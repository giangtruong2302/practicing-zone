## Sections

### Algorithms
This section contains implementations of various algorithms. You can find functions for sorting, searching, and calculating Fibonacci sequences.

### Data Structures
Here, you will find implementations of common data structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists. Each data structure includes methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

### System Design
This section outlines key concepts and examples related to system design. It includes high-level designs for systems like URL shorteners and chat applications.

### Coding Challenges
This section presents various coding challenges that are commonly encountered in interviews. It includes solutions for problems such as two-sum, string reversal, and palindrome checking.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile the TypeScript files:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
5. Run the tests (if applicable):
   ```
   npm test
   ```

## Usage Examples

- To use the sorting algorithm, import the `sortArray` function from the algorithms section.
- To implement a stack, create an instance of the `Stack` class from the data structures section.
- For system design, call the `designURLShortener` function to see the design outline.
- Solve coding challenges by importing the respective functions from the coding challenges section.

## Conclusion

This workspace is a comprehensive resource for practicing and enhancing your technical skills. Use it to prepare for your upcoming interviews and to deepen your understanding of key concepts in programming and system design.
